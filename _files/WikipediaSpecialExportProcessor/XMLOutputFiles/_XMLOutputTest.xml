player Braulio Castro scored a controversial goal in the championship match where the ball clearly went out of play but rebounded off a kinesiologykinesiologists medicine cabinet back into play in the buildup to the goal This turned out to be the only goal of the game and the opposition Club Nacional de FootballNacional felt very hard done by and three of their players were PenaltycardRedcardsent off for assaulting the referee in annoyance at the goal This meant that the referee Telésforo Rodríguez was unable to continue through injury so one of the linesmenassistant referees Luis Scandroglio stepped in and immediately abandoned the match due to bad light after seventy minutesref namersssf1ref  Over two months later on 30 July the League Board decided to disallow the goal and also rescinded one of the three aforementioned sendingsoff that of Ulises Chifflet They also ruled that the final twenty minutes would be played at Estadio Centenario but behind closed doors to try to avoid the same controversy which had plagued the original encounter The match went ahead behind closed doors and there were no goals in the twenty minutes In a highly unorthodox move two sessions of extratime were played the usual allowance would be a single session the score remained goallessref namersssf1  Club Nacional de FootballNacionals fans remember this game as the 9 contra 11 9 against 11 since their team played the remaining 20 minutes plus both overtimes totalling over 80 minutes with nine players   A second playoff which consisted of a standard match followed once again by two sessions of extratime was played on 2 September but still the deadlock wasnt brokenref namersssf1   A third playoff was contested on 18 November and Héctor Castro played a vital role in this match scoring a hattrick which meant twice equalising as well as scoring the winning goal for Nacional MontevideoNacional in a 32 win over Peñarol which finally settled the Uruguayan Championship almost six months after the controversial first playoff This controversial playoff also meant that the Uruguayan Championship of 1933 was bizarrely not awarded until November 1934ref nam</text><text>rsssf1

began to merge or fold   The Marksmen one of the strongest ASL teams had merged with the New York Soccer Club to form the New York Yankees soccerNew York Yankees in 1930  Then in 1931 the Yankees
